    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
        <br><br>
